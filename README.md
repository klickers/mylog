This repo must be used in conjunction with [`klickers/mylogks`](https://github.com/klickers/mylogks). I made this as an activity log for myself, so I could look back on the things I accomplished during the day. (I don't use this to track "wasted" or neutral time; I already have Toggl and Activity Watch for that.)
